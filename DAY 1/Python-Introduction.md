### Python:

Developed By: Guido van Rossum in late 1980s.

Python isn't a young language, it has been around for 20 years and it is "mature" and "trustworthy".

Python implements "Object-Oriented Programming" paradigm.

#### Why should we Python?

Very simple to learn, every new entrant should start here. Being free, OpenSourced, very popular in developer community. That means there are many addon libraries that are developed and maintained by community. Large userbase means, easy to share knowledge.

Some generic advantages pointed out as:

- Easy to learn
- Easy to teach
- Easy to use
- Easy to understand

#### So many Advantages, but are there any flaws/disadvantages?

Frankly, to any new learner, this does not matter. But seasonsed Software Developers, Architects do - have some opinions, system/application requirement wise these might differ, but some of those are:

- Speed, Python is not that fast as compared to some other languages.
- Hard to debug, in some cases.

Again these are generic cases, this does not apply in all cases.

### Programming Language Type:
Interpreter

#### "Interpreter" What does that mean?
Everytime to run/execute a block to code, every line has to be translated from Human readable to Machine readable format. 

"Read-Check-Execute" method has to be used multiple times.

Also, means that - the "end-user" also need to have interpret to execute he code.

Also, this is the reason why Python is known as Scripting language.

### Inspiration of name, Python?
Type of snake? Nopes.. 

A famous Televison series, "Monty Python's Flying Circus", inspired the developer to name, the language "Python".

### Where do we see Python live in Action?

Python is used extensively in implmentation of Complex Internet services like Search Engines, Cloud Storage and tools.

Many development tools are implemented in Python.

Complex calculations and applications used for Scientific purpose are implemented in Python.

Testing, Automation are some domains where Python is used regularly.


### Version? Python 2 and Python 3

Currently in market there are 2 version of Python, 2 and 3.

Python 2 is an Older version, of which future development has been stalled. Still it gets updates for Bug-fixes and Security-fixes.

Python 3, not only is a better version of Python 2, although being similar too; but is almost a new language, with much rich features.

Mostly all new development is taking place in Python 3.


### Who maintains all this?

Apart from versions 2 and 3 there are many other versions of Python.

**_PSF (Python Software Foundation)_** maintains **CPython**, which is the original Canonical, or reference Python.
Cpython - Guido van Rossum used "C" language to implement Python and till date this is in force.

All versions of Python coming from **_PSF_** are written in "C" language.

Reason for "C"; easily portable on any platform, as virtually all platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac) can compile and run Python with ease.

**Jython**, is an version of Python written entirely in _Java_.

**PyPy**, Python written in _Python_.
